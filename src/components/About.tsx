      <h2>I'm a Aspiring Software Engineer</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently a senior at Westhill High School. I have taken classes
        such as Data Structures & Algorithms, Cyber Security and AP CSA. I am
        currently a TA for DSA
        <br />
        I have a passion for software development and I am currently learning
        more about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
        <br />
        When I'm not coding, you can find me tutoring Computer Science,
        volunteering, playing the guitar, solving Rubik's Cubes, or watching a
        movie.
